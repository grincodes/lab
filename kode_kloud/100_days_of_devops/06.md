# Quest

The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.
b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.


# Process & Solutions
A cron job is an automated task scheduled to run periodically. It is managed by a background service called the cron daemon, which checks the crontab (cron table) file every minute for scheduled tasks. All jobs must be defined in this crontab file in advance to execute at the specified times.

- ssh into every server and run the following commands
- install cronie or cron equivalent 
    ```
        sudo yum install cronie -y 
    ```
- start and enable crond (cron deamon) 
    ```
    sudo systemctl start crond && sudo systemctl enable crond
    ```

- add cron expression/job to crontab  as root (-e):
    ```
        sudo crontab -e
    ```
- insert the cron expression in the vi editor and save
  ```
    */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
  ```
- confirm cron job with this command
    ```
        sudo crontab -l 
    ```
