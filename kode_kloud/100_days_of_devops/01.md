# Quest
Add a user (riva) with a non interactive shell on server 3.

# Process and Solution
- ssh into server 3 from jumphost using provided credentials
  ```ssh username@host```
- Enter this linux command on server to create user with no interactive shell
    ``` sudo useradd riva -s /usr/sbin/nologin```

# Learnings
There are 2 ways of achieving this, i used sbin beacuse it returns an error message when user (riva)
tries to access the terminal.
The other way we can use to restrict user interaction with shell is to set shell ```-s /bin/false```
This approach immediately exits the terminal without returing the cause of the error.

# Good to Know Commands
```/usr/sbin``` - is the location where system binaries stored 
```useradd -D```  to check shell defaults set when creating a user
```cat /etc/shells``` used to check active shells
