# Quests
Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on port 5003 (which is the Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.

Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.

Once fixed, you can test the same using command curl http://stapp01:5003 command from jump host.

Note: Please do not try to alter the existing index.html code, as it will lead to task failure.


# Process and Solutions

- confirm the error by runing this cmd on jump host
    ```
        curl http://stapp01:5003
    ```
    It should return No host configured

- ssh into serve 1
    ```
         ssh user@host
    ```

- check open ports on the server
    ```
        netstat -tln
    ```

- we can see that the port is used by another process not apache
  so we need to stop the process and restart httpd (Apache)
  ```
    sudo systemctl stop sendmail
    sudo systemctl start httpd
  ```
- 
  ```
    sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5003 -j ACCEPT
    sudo service iptables save
  ```


sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :5003


sudo systemctl stop sendmail
sudo systemctl start httpd


[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5003/tcp
sudo: firewall-cmd: command not found
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5003 -j ACCEPT

[tony@stapp01 ~]$ 
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo service iptables save
