# Quest

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure the thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users (i.e tony for app server 1). Based on the requirements, perform the following:

Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.


# Process and Solutions
  ## Why is this neccessary 
   - Automation 
    Scripts cannot type password when prompted for password. For them to run on a schedule or across 100 at once , the connection must be seamless

- generate ssh keys 
   ``` 
   ssh-key-gen -t rsa 
   ```
- copy the generated public key to the other servers
  
  For this to work the user tony must have been created on other servers. 
   we are just trying to make ssh work without password.

   Run this command for all the servers stapp01 ,stapp02,stapp03
    ```
        ssh-copy-id  tony@stapp01 
    ```
    It automatically copies your public key (usually from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the remote server.
    It appends that key to the file /home/tony/.ssh/authorized_keys and sets the correct file permissions.
