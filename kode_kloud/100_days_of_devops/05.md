# Quest
Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 2 in the Stratos Datacenter:

Install the required SELinux packages.

Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.

No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.

Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.

# Process and Solution

- ssh into app server 2 with this cmd ``` ssh username@host```
- check the os version/linux distro with this cmd 
    ``` cat /etc/os-release ```
- install SElinux package (check insallation instruction for your particular linux distro)
    ``` 
    sudo yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils libselinux-utils setools-console
   ```
- permanantely disable selinux by updating the config
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
    ```
- locate the SELINUX= line and chage its value to disabled
    ```
        SELINUX=disabled
    ```
