# Quest
Following security audits, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.
Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.

# Process and Solution
## Purpose
Disabling direct SSH root login is a good security protocol to ensure that every remote access 
to the any of the server can be traced to a particular user.

## Solution
For this usecase we have 3 servers. 
- we need to login to to each of the server and disable the ssh rootlogin
    ```
    ssh usersv1@sv1

    ```

- open the ssh config in vi editor
    ``` 
    sudo vi \etc\ssh\sshd_config 

    ```

- set PermitRootLogin to no
    ```
      PermitRootLogin no

    ```

- restart sshd deamon 
  ```
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
  ```
