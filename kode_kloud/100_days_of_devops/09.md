# Quest
There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.

# Process and Solution

- ssh into the db server
    ```
        ssh user@host
    ```
- check the status of mariadb service
    ```
        sudo systemctl status mariadb
    ```
    Output: service was inactive (dead).
    with suggestions to check 
    ```
    sudo systemctl status mariadb 
    sudo journalctl -xeu mariadb --no-pager

    ```

-  running this cmd ``` sudo journalctl -xeu mariadb --no-pager ``` to check mariadb logs
   checking the logs i noticed that mariadb was trying to create a test data on /var/mysql
   but the folder does not exist so it failed

- stop mariadb service  ``` sudo systemctl stop mariadb ```

-  create the directory and give mysql ownership 
    ```
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql
    sudo chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
    sudo chmod 750 /var/lib/mysql
    ```
- restart mariadb and check the status 

    ```
        sudo systemctl restart mariadb
        sudo systemctl status mariadb
    ```
