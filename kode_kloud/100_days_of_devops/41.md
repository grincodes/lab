# Quests

As per recent requirements shared by the Nautilus application development team, they need custom images created for one of their projects. Several of the initial testing requirements are already been shared with DevOps team. Therefore, create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile (please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 1 in Stratos DC and configure to build an image with the following requirements:

a. Use ubuntu:24.04 as the base image.

b. Install apache2 and configure it to work on 6400 port. (do not update any other Apache configuration settings like document root etc).

# Process and Solutions

- ssh into server 1
    ```
        ssh user@host
    ```
- create a dockerfile in /opt/docker/Dockerfile

    ```
        sudo vi /opt/docker/Dockerfile
    ```
- add the following to the Dockerfile
    ```
        FROM ubuntu:24.04
        RUN  apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2

        # Configure Apache to listen on port 6400
        RUN sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 6400/' /etc/apache2/ports.conf
        RUN sed -i 's/<VirtualHost \*:80>/<VirtualHost \*:6400>/' /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
        # Expose port 6400
        EXPOSE 6400
        # Start Apache in the foreground
        CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
    ```

- build Docker image
    ```
        cd /opt/docker
        docker build -t apache:6400 .
    ```
