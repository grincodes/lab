# Quests
The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:

PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.

a. Create a database user kodekloud_rin and set its password to dCV3szSGNA.
b. Create a database kodekloud_db1 and grant full permissions to user kodekloud_rin on this database.

Note: Please do not try to restart PostgreSQL server service.

# Process and Solutions

- ssh into db server
    ```
     ssh user@host
    ```
- connect as the postgres superuser
  ```
     psql -U postgres
  ```
-  create user kodekloud_rin with password dCV3szSGNA
    ```
    CREATE USER kodekloud_rin WITH PASSWORD 'dCV3szSGNA'
    ```
- create db kodekloud_db1
    ```
        CREATE DATABASE kodekloud_db1;
    ```
- Grant full permissions to kodekloud_rin on kodekloud_db1 db
    ```
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kodekloud_db1 TO kodekloud_rin;
    ```
```
- verify user 
    ```
        \du
    ```
