# Quests
The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.


Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not have hosted any code yet on these servers, so you don’t need to worry if Apache isn’t serving any pages. Just make sure the service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 8082 on all app servers.


# Process and Solutions

- ssh into all servers 
    ```
     ssh user@host
    ```
- check httpd status to see if its active and running
    ```
         sudo systemctl status httpd
    ```
- if its not active check the logs to discover what the issue is
    ```
        journalctl -u httpd
    ```
-  in this case apache couldnt use port 8082  because its already in use
   so we check to see the process using this port with netstat or ss
   ```
        sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :8082
   ```
    or 
   ```
    sudo ss -tlnp | grep :8082
   ```

-  once you get the service kill it or stop it
    ```
        sudo systemctl stop <email_service>
    ```

- restart apache service
    ```
        sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```
