# Quests
Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch xfusioncorp_blog from master branch in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog git repo.

Please do not try to make any changes in the code.

# Process and Solutions

    ```
         ssh user@host
    ```
- go to the repo directory
    ```
        cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
    ```
- give natasha the right ownership on the repo

    ```
         sudo chown -R natasha:natasha /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
    ```
- create a new branch from master branch
    ```
