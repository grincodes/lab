# Quest
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:


1. Install and configure nginx on App Server 1.

2. On App Server 1 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.

3. Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.

4. For final testing try to access the App Server 1 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://{app-server-ip}/.

# Process and Solutions

- ssh into App Server 1
  ```
    ssh user@host
  ```
- install nginx
    ```
        sudo yum install -y nginx
    ```

- start and enable nginx service
    ```
        sudo systemctl start nginx
        sudo systemctl enable nginx
    ```
- move cert to some appropriate location
  ```
    sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/nautilus.crt

    sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/pki/tls/private/nautilus.key
  ```
-  update the default index.html content 
    ```
     echo 'Welcome!' | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
    ```
-  add ssl conf to nginx conf
    ```
        sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl.conf
    ```
-  add this content to the file 
    You can get config from [here](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=nginx&version=1.20.1&config=intermediate&openssl=3.4.0&guideline=5.7)
    ```
        server {
             listen 443 ssl http2;
             listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

            ssl_certificate /etc/pki/tls/certs/nautilus.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/pki/tls/key/nautilus.key;

            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index index.html;
        }
    ```
-  confirm if nginx config has no errors
    ```
        sudo nginx -t
    ```
- reload nginx 
    ```
        sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```

-  curl -Ik https://stapp01/.
