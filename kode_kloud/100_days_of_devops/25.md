# Quests
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/games.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

Create a new branch datacenter in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.

# Process and Solutions
- ssh into storage server
    ```
        ssh user@host
    ```
- cd into games repo 
    ```
        cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games
    ```
- give user neccessary permissions 
    ```
        sudo chown -R natasha:natasha /opt/games.git
        git config --global user.email "natasha@xfusioncorp.com"
        git config --global user.name. ""natasha"
        git config --global --add safe.directory /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
    ``` 
    or simple run commands as root 
    ```
        sudo -i
    ```
-  create a new branch
    ```
        git checkout -b datacenter
    ```

- copy index.html from temp to repo
    ```
        sudo cp /tmp/index.html .
    ```
-  git add and commit file to datacenter branch
    ```
        git add .
        git commit -m "added index.html"
        git push origin datacenter
    ```
-  git merge changes to master and push
    ```
        git checkout master
        git merge datacenter

        git push origin master
    ```
