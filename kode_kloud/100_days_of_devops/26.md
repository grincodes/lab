# Quests
The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/cluster.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster. Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster repository as per details mentioned below:

a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster repo add a new remote dev_cluster and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git repository.

b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.

c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.

# Process and solution

- ssh into storage server
    ```
        ssh user@host
    ```

-  cd into /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster folder and add remote url
    ```
        cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster 
        git remote add dev_official /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git

    ```

-   copy the index.html from tmp to the repo folder
    ```
        cp /tmp/index.html .
        git add index.html
        git commit -m "Add index.html to master branch"
    ```
