# Quest
The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:

a. Install tomcat server on App Server 1.
b. Configure it to run on port 8082.
c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.

Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp01:8082

# Process and Solution

- ssh into App server 1
    ```
     ssh user@host
    ```
- install tomcat
  ```
    sudo yum install tomcat
  ```
- configure tomcat to run port 8082
   ```
     sudo vi  /etc/tomcat/server.xml
   ```
   update connector port to 8082
   ```
    <Connector port="8082" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443" />
   ```

- restart tomcat service
    ```
        sudo systemctl restart tomcat
    ```

- ssh to jumphost  ``` ssh user@host ```
- create ssh keys if it doesnt exist 
    ```
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    ```
- propagate key to app server 1  to allow passwordless acess to server
   ```
    ssh-copy-id user@host
   ```
- copy ROOT.war from jumphost to Appserver1
  ```
    scp /tmp/ROOT.war user@host:/tmp
    sudo mv /tmp/ROOT.war /var/lib/tomcat/webapps
  ```
- confirm the server runs
    ```
        curl http://stapp01:8082
    ```
