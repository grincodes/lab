# Quests
The Nautilus DevOps team possesses confidential data on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter. A container named ubuntu_latest is running on the same server.



Copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from the docker host to the ubuntu_latest container located at /tmp/. Ensure the file is not modified during this operation.

# Process and Solutions

- ssh into app server 3
    ```
        ssh user@host
    ```
- cp file from host to docker container
    ```
         docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg  ubuntu_latest:/tmp
    ```

- exec into container to verify
    ```
        docker exec -it ubuntu_latest /bin/bash/

        find /tmp -iname "nautilus.txt.gpg"
    ```
