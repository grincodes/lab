# Quests
During the weekly meeting, the Nautilus DevOps team discussed about the automation and configuration management solutions that they want to implement. While considering several options, the team has decided to go with Ansible for now due to its simple setup and minimal pre-requisites. The team wanted to start testing using Ansible, so they have decided to use jump host as an Ansible controller to test different kind of tasks on rest of the servers.



Install ansible version 4.9.0 on Jump host using pip3 only. Make sure Ansible binary is available globally on this system, i.e all users on this system are able to run Ansible commands.

# Process and Solutions

- check if pip3 is already installed by runing this command
    ```
        pip3 -v
    ```
- once you have pip3 , you can go ahead and run the following command to install ansible and make it 
  available globally.
  ```
    sudo pip3 install ansible==4.9.0 --prefix=/usr/local
  ```
 
 To make a binary globally accessible it needs to be in the system wide binary folders (/usr/local,/user/bin, /bin)
 Placing a binary in these folders makes it "globally accessible" because these directories are included in the default system-wide $PATH environment variable.

 - confirm that ansible has been installed
    
    ```
        ansible --version
    ```
