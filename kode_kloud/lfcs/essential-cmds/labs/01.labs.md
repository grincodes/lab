# Notes 
```
In Linux, a hostname is a unique label assigned to a computer to identify it within a network. It serves as a human-friendly alternative to numeric IP addresses, making it easier for users and system services to recognize and communicate with specific machines. 
Types of Hostnames
Modern Linux distributions (especially those using systemd) distinguish between three types of hostnames: 
Static Hostname: The primary, persistent identity stored in /etc/hostname. It is used by the kernel during boot and must follow strict naming rules (alphanumeric characters and hyphens only, no spaces).
Transient Hostname: A temporary name assigned at runtime, often provided by a DHCP or mDNS server if a static name is not set.
Pretty Hostname: A free-form, human-readable description (e.g., "Alice's Work Laptop") stored in /etc/machine-info. It can include spaces and special characters but is used only for user interfaces, not for network identification. 
How to Manage Hostnames
The following commands and files are used to view and modify hostnames: 
Viewing the Hostname:
hostname: Displays the current short name.
hostnamectl: Provides a detailed status, including static, transient, and pretty names.
Changing the Hostname:
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname [new-name]: The standard method for permanently changing the static hostname on modern systems.
sudo hostname [new-name]: Changes the hostname temporarily until the next reboot.
Core Configuration Files:
/etc/hostname: Contains the persistent name of the local system.
/etc/hosts: Maps the hostname to local IP addresses (like 127.0.0.1) to ensure local applications can resolve the name without external DNS.

```
Host: node01
Username: bob
Password: caleston123
```
Remember to type exit when you finish this task.
# Solution
- ssh into node01
```
ssh bob@node01
```
- create the file
```
touch /home/bob/myfile
```

# Q9
We are trying to run the apropos ssh command to get some details about the commands related to ssh, but we are getting this error:
ssh: nothing appropriate.
Look into the issue and fix it to make the apropos ssh command work.

# Answer
apropos is not returning anything because there is probably nothing on the mandb 
- Run this command to create/populate mandb 
```
sudo mandb
```

# Q10
Using the apropos command, find out the configuration file for NFS mounts and save its name in the /home/bob/nfs file.

Is the configuration file name NFS mounts saved in the "/home/bob/nfs" file?

# Answer
Execute the below command::


apropos "NFS mounts"



You will see an output as below:


nfsmount.conf (5)    - Configuration file for NFS mounts



Create the required file and save the config file name in it:


vi /home/bob/nfs



The file content should be as below:


nfsmount.conf
